# GitHub Marketplace Preparation Guide

This document provides detailed guidance on preparing the Smart Release Notes Generator for submission to the GitHub Marketplace, including review requirements, testing procedures, and monetization options.

## 1. Review Requirements Checklist

GitHub will review your action for the following criteria before approving it for the Marketplace:

### Security Requirements
- [x] No hardcoded secrets or tokens
- [x] Proper handling of user-provided tokens
- [x] Dependencies are regularly updated (Dependabot configured)
- [x] CodeQL analysis enabled for vulnerability detection
- [ ] Security policy documented in SECURITY.md
- [ ] Proper input validation to prevent injection attacks

### Documentation Quality
- [x] Clear README with installation and usage instructions
- [x] Examples of different configuration options
- [x] Screenshots or GIFs showing the action in use
- [x] Badges for build status and other relevant information
- [x] Comparison with alternatives
- [ ] Troubleshooting section for common issues

### Marketplace Guidelines Adherence
- [x] action.yml with proper metadata
- [x] Branding information (icon and color)
- [x] License file (MIT)

### Performance and Reliability
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- [ ] Integration tests with real GitHub API
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Error handling for all edge cases
- [ ] Graceful degradation when rate limited

## 2. Testing Your Action

To ensure your action is thoroughly tested before submission:

### Unit Testing
- Implement Jest tests for all core functionality
- Mock GitHub API responses for predictable testing
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### Integration Testing
Create a test workflow that uses your action:

```yaml
name: Test Release Notes Action

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Generate Release Notes
        uses: ./
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Verify Output
        run: |
          if [ -z "${{ steps.release-notes.outputs.release-notes }}" ]; then
            echo "Release notes output is empty"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Performance Testing
- Test with repositories of different sizes
- Measure execution time and memory usage
- Document performance characteristics in README

## 3. Visual Assets

### Logo Requirements
- SVG format preferred
- Simple design that scales well
- Visible at small sizes
- Follows GitHub's design guidelines

### Screenshots/GIFs
- Show the action in use
- Highlight key features
- Include examples of different output formats
- Demonstrate customization options

## 4. Monetization Options

### Free with Support Tiers
- Basic: Free for all users
- Premium: $X/month for priority support
- Enterprise: $XX/month for dedicated support and custom features

### Open Core Model
- Free version with basic functionality
- Pro version with advanced features
- Enterprise version with custom integrations

### GitHub Sponsors
- Enable GitHub Sponsors for your repository
- Offer sponsor-only features or priority support
- Set up sponsorship tiers with different benefits

### Enterprise Licensing
- Offer custom enterprise licenses
- Provide additional features for enterprise customers
- Implement license verification in your action

## 5. Submission Process

1. Ensure all requirements are met
2. Create a new release with semantic versioning
3. Go to repository settings > "Publish to Marketplace"
4. Fill out all required information:
   - Primary category
   - Detailed description
   - Screenshots
   - Support contact information
   - Pricing plan (if applicable)
5. Submit for review
